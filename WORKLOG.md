# Work Log

## GROUP MEMBER 1: Anna Shrestha

### Wed, 5/22

Start on outline of project(create branches, processing sketches) and begin researching implementation of audio steganography and file types. Notes/planning document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oLgrYbuv7iW_9uCib4jDbt9lGG-MdMGzmmYyTHb14_0/edit.

### Thur, 5/23

Do more research on Audacity (how to view frequency) and try to get encoded audio to test decoder. Look through Java's AudioSystem and Processing's Sound library. Outline of decode started, need to research bitrates/byte arrays/spectrograms.

### Fri, 5/24

Attempt to start decode using java's audio manipulation commands. Trying to change frequency to hide at inaudible frequencies and use least sig bit encoding but confused by bitrate and the number of bits in a second-which bit do we encode in?? Looking through AudioInputStream, FloatControl, and the Discrete/Fast Fourier Transform. Also researched pulse-code modulation (PCM) encoding --> lossless compression method (bitstream is lossy).

### Sun, 5/26

Start working on video script (background about audio steganography and spectrograms).

## GROUP MEMBER 2: Regina Chen

### Wed, 5/22

- Research on implementing audio files and manipulating it in processing.
- Started on encoding String into audio file, using .wav file extension.
- Added a .wav file into sketch for testing

### Thur, 5/23

- trying out the different methods in sound library
- trying out frames and channels to manipulate the ultrasound range for embedding another audio file
- playing around with audacity
